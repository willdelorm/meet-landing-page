## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

Loved that this was a bigger project compared to previous Frontend Mentor challenges! This landing page really stretched my brain to make elements flow smoothly between different breakpoints.

### Continued development

Nearly 400 lines of styling code later, I feel there is a balance to optimizing my code so I don't need to make as many adjustments for each breakpoint. Looking forward, I would like to plan responsiveness ahead of time instead of making multiple passes per breakpoint.
